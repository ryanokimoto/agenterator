## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Decisions

### Backend Architecture
```
API Layer (FastAPI)
    ‚Üì
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    ‚Üì
Data Layer (PostgreSQL + Vector DB)
    ‚Üì
Processing Layer (Celery Workers)
```

### Key Technology Choices
1. **Vector Database**: Start with Qdrant (self-hosted) or Pinecone (managed)
2. **LLM Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4 initially, add Claude/local models later
3. **File Processing**: Unstructured.io for unified extraction
4. **Search**: Hybrid approach with BM25 + semantic search

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables
users (id, email, created_at)
agents (id, user_id, name, description)
documents (id, agent_id, filename, status)
chunks (id, document_id, content, embedding)
conversations (id, agent_id, user_id)
messages (id, conversation_id, role, content)
```

## üìä Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**
   - Time to first answer < 5 seconds
   - Answer accuracy > 90%
   - User retention > 60%

2. **Technical Performance**
   - Document processing < 30 seconds
   - 99.9% uptime
   - Support 1000+ concurrent users

3. **Business Metrics**
   - User acquisition cost
   - Monthly active users
   - Document upload volume

## üöÄ MVP Definition (4-6 weeks)

**Minimum Viable Product includes:**
1. User authentication
2. Single agent creation
3. PDF/TXT file upload
4. Basic RAG chat interface
5. Simple web interface

**MVP does NOT include:**
1. Advanced file formats
